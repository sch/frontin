# [Frontin](http://alexduloz.github.com/frontin/)

## A simple, lightweight template which advocates using Wordpress as a Front Controller

[Project homepage](http://alexduloz.github.com/frontin/)

The concept is quite simple: Wordpress has the ability to call the index.php file of a given template every time a page is requested, thus mimicking the Front Controller Pattern. Frontin embraces this idiosyncrasy of Wordpress to both minimize code repetition and emancipate your projects from usual Wordpress behaviors.
Therefore, in Frontin you will not find specific Wordpress files such as “single.php” (at least not in the traditional way).
Static files also play an important role in Frontin’s philosophy.

## Install
Download Frontin and upload the "frontin" directory on your WP project like any other regular WP template.

## Config

The __config.php file contains a few settings that you can change.


## The "assets" directory

All the familiar Wordpress pages are located in the "assets" directory (the only difference with a casual template is that they’re not called directly by Wordpress, but through index.php).


## The steroid version

Frontin has been used as the blueprint for [CurtainsUp For Wordpress](url)
