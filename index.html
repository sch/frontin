  <div id="what" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">What?</h1>
    <p>Frontin is a simple, lightweight template which advocates using Wordpress as a Front Controller. The concept is quite simple: Wordpress has the ability to call the index.php file of a given template every time a page is requested, thus mimicking the Front Controller Pattern.</p>
    <p>Frontin embraces this idiosyncrasy of Wordpress to both minimize code repetition and emancipate your projects from usual Wordpress behaviors. Therefore, in Frontin you will not find specific Wordpress files such as single.php (at least not in the traditional way). That's also because <a href="#static-content" title="Static Content">static content</a> plays an important role in Frontin's philosophy.</p>
  </div>


  <div id="granular-control" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">Granular Control</h1>
    <p>Frontin was built to give you granular control over your Wordpress project. The index.php file makes it easy to detect a specific page/post/category (you name it) and associate a specific action to it.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
if ( is_page( 'send-tweet' ) ) {
      // Connect to Twitter API
}

if ( is_page( 'pull-request' ) ) {
      // Connect to Github API
}

// etc.
    </code>
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div id="static-content" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">Static Content</h1>
    <p>Behind Frontin lies a philosophy of static content. Create a page or a post in your adminCP, leave it empty, catch it in index.php and load a static file instead of content stored in a db.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
// This code assumes you have created
// a page named some_static_page in
// your adminCP.

if ( is_page( "some_static_page" ) ) {
	include static/some_static_page.html;
}
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>You can write static content <em>and</em> benefit from Wordpress stats, plugins etc.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="beyond-wordpress" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">Beyond Wordpress: __config.php</h1>
    <p>The __config.php lets you easily configure include paths to use your favourite PHP libraries in your projects. Here's an example with the Zend Framework:</p>
    <pre>
// Directory structure:
    frontin
        __config.php
        library
            Zend
        ...
    </pre>
    <pre>
    <code>
// __config.php
// Easy Include
define( 'PROJECT_PATH', realpath( dirname( __FILE__ ) ) );

set_include_path( implode( PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
    realpath( PROJECT_PATH ),
    realpath( PROJECT_PATH . 'parts' ),
    realpath( PROJECT_PATH . 'assets' ),
    realpath( PROJECT_PATH . 'shared' ),
    realpath( PROJECT_PATH . 'static' ),
    realpath( PROJECT_PATH . 'library' ),
    realpath( PROJECT_PATH . 'library/Zend' ),
    get_include_path() 
) ) );
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>All ZF components are now available in your project:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
require_once 'Zend/Whatever/You/Want.php';
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Empowering Wordpress with other powerful tools should be made a lot easier.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="as-little-markup-as-possible" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">As Little Markup As Possible</h1>
    <p>Frontin provides very little markup and tries to keep it as neutral possible. Although you are going to find some common layout elements (a banner, a footer etc.), you can easily remove such elements from your whole project by editing your index.php file. 
    <pre>
    <code>
&lt;?php include 'parts/banner.php'; ?&gt;
&lt;?php include 'parts/main.php'; ?&gt;
&lt;?php //include 'parts/complementary.php'; /* no longer used */ ?&gt;
&lt;?php //include 'parts/contentinfo.php'; /* no longer used */ ?&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Including a new layout element is as easy as removing one: add whatever you want in index.php and you will see it appear everywhere on your project.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
&lt;?php include 'parts/mynav.php'; ?&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>
  </div>
  
  <div id="structural-outline" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">A "From Structure To Content" Outline</h1>
    <p>Frontin's markup does its best to remain neutral (you will not find any semantic statements in this project). The only opinionated code is a <a href="http://www.bitspushedaround.com/of-html-document-outlines/" title="Bitspushedaround - Outline">from structure to content outline</a>. Here again, if this approach doesn't fit your project or your own peculiar to coding, it can easily be removed.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="yet-a-conventional-approach-is-possible" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">Yet, A Conventional Approach Is Possible</h1>
    <p>All the familiar Wordpress pages are located in the assets directory (the only difference with a casual template is that they're not called directly by Wordpress, but through index.php). If you want to use Wordpress in a more conventional way, you can edit those pages as if you were working with a typical template. If you go that way, you still have the benefits of Frontin: little markup and little code repetition.</p>
  </div>


  <div id="the-steroid-version" class="explanation">
    <h1 class="h-alpha">The steroid version</h1>
    <p>Frontin has been used as the blueprint for <a href="#">CurtainsUp For Wordpress</a>.</p>
